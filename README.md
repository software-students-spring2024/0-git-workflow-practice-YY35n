I recently came across this [fascinating article](https://www.mtu.edu/cs/undergraduate/software/what/#:~:text=Software%20engineering%20is%20the%20branch,software%20solutions%20for%20end%20users.)


Career opportunities in software engineering are driven by new technologies in automobiles, aviation, data management, telecommunications, factory control, robotics, defense, and security. Software engineers may develop computer games, business applications, operating systems, network control systems, and more. A bachelor's degree or higher is often required to work as a software engineer.
